# PRODIGY_DS_05
Description: For Task 5, I analyzed traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Leveraging Python and data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, I processed and visualized the accident data obtained from sources like. I explored relationships between variables such as road conditions, weather conditions, time of day, and the frequency/severity of accidents. Additionally, I visualized accident hotspots on maps and identified contributing factors to accidents.

Key Insights:

Identified common factors contributing to traffic accidents, such as slippery road conditions during rainy weather.
Visualized accident hotspots using geographical plotting tools like Folium or Matplotlib's basemap.
Analyzed trends in accident occurrence based on time of day and day of the week.
